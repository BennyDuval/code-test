# CCLRC IT and Software Engineer Code Test

## Part 1: Data Transformation
Here is a link to an endpoint for parcel data with an XML stream. 

```
link
```

Using Python and Flask, write an endpoint script that takes the XML stream and outputs the data in json format. The endpoint should have all the data coming in from the XML stream. 

## Part 2: Front-End Presenation
Using Javascript and/or JQuery, and Bootstrap (or a combination), create a simple webpage that takes the endpoint from part 1 and displays all the information in a clear, readable interface. 

The XML stream includes latitude and longitude points for the parcel which should also be part of your Part 1 API output. Using Google Maps API, embed a map on this page showing the location of the parcel with some basic information (Street address, Owner etc.). You should be able to use the free quota of the Google Maps API for this. 

Feel free to be creative and keep in mind that there will be a lot of data on one page so how you layout the information will aid in readability. 

## Completion and Submission
Completed work should include all code to arrive at the solution, plus assets and resources required to run Part 2. 

PLEASE INCLUDE a detailed README containing the requirements and instructions to run the project locally. 

All completed work should be pushed to a public repo on Github.
